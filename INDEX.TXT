Notes on the C++ code for "Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms"
by James O. Coplien, Addison-Wesley, 1992, ISBN 0-201-54855-0.

............................. The Layout .............................

Most figures are contained in individual files named for their figure
designation in the book.  Examples outside of figures can be associated
with the chapter in which they appear by the leading digit in their name.
Each file is a clear ASCII file (that is, the files are not archived
in any way).  You can send individual files like this:

    send 2-4.c from c++/idioms
    send 2-2a.c from c++/idioms
    send 5-2.c from c++/idioms
    send fbubble.c from c++/idioms

The complete list of files is:

10-1.c          3-15.c          5-15.c          7-5.c           emptr.h
10-2.c          3-16.c          5-16.c          8-1.c           erect.c
11-2.c          3-18.c          5-17.c          8-2.h           erect.h
2-2a.c          3-19.c          5-18.c          8-3a.c          eshape.c
2-2b.c          3-2.c           5-19.c          8-3b.c          eshape.h

Many of these files are simply text for figures presenting code fragments,
and are not intended to be compilable without additional surrounding
context.  Where it is reasonable to do so, I have provided enough context
for the code to pass compilation.  Many examples are frameworks which
may be fleshed out by the reader as exercises.

................... Notes on platform dependencies ...................

Much of the code was written assuming the existence of basic libraries
to support iostreams (iostream.h), Strings (String.h), and others.
Most systems provide header files and library code for these abstractions.
In some cases, minor modifications to the code provided here may be
necessary for the code to work on a given platform.  Much of the code of
Chapter 9 and of Appendix E is environment-dependent.

........................... Closing Remarks ..........................

I provide this code with the hope it can be of use as a model for
building richer, application-specific abstractions in your own
domain.  Much of the code can be compiled and run for pedagogical
purposes.  I have compiled and run all of the complete, self-contained
examples provided.  If you have problems compiling an example you
think should compile, please let me know and I will try to be of
assistance.  I will keep this archive up-to-date on research!netlib,
to reflect fixes as well as incorporation of additional code from
the book.
